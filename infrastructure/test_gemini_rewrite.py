    The activation function is a very important component of neural networks that has been studied 
    extensively in recent years. It is used to introduce non-linearity into the network which allows 
    it to learn complex patterns. There are many different activation functions that have been proposed, 
    such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. Each of these functions has its own advantages and disadvantages 
    that need to be considered when designing a neural network. In this work, we propose a new activation 
    function that combines the benefits of existing functions while addressing their limitations.
