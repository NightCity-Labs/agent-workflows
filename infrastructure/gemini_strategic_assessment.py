PAPER:

Provide a strategic assessment covering:

## Current Positioning
- What is this paper's current strength?
- Where does it stand vs typical NeurIPS papers?
- Estimated current outcome: reject/poster/spotlight/oral?

## Path to Spotlight/Oral
- What would make this a spotlight?
- What would make this an oral?
- What's the gap between current state and those goals?

## Key Leverage Points
- What 2-3 improvements would have highest impact?
- What's currently holding it back most?
- What's the low-hanging fruit?

## Impact Potential
- What's the potential citation impact?
- What communities would care about this?
- What follow-up work could it enable?

## Recommended Strategy
- Should we aim for spotlight or be content with poster?
- What's the priority order for improvements?
- What should we NOT change (already strong)?

Be honest and strategic. Think like an area chair deciding between 100 papers."""
